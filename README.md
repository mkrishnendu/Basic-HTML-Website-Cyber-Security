# Basic-HTML-Website-Cyber-Security

## What is it?

This website was made during my college presentation and here, I am trying to convey the need for Cyber Security and how to prevent malicious activities through it, and also how to safeguard our children from child predators. It's a really simple and basic HTML, CSS, and JS-based website.

## About

Technological advances are changing the world in ways that could not have been imagined. The emergence of advanced digital innovations are providing new opportunities to connect and learn, and have begun influencing every aspect of human life. Children and young people have shown greater ability to adapt and adopt digital devices and innovations, which augurs well for the future. They use the devices and apps for a variety of functions, including self-expression, communication, networking, research, entertainment, and much more. The internet has enabled children to become active social agents and to mobilise for social, ecological and other causes. They are increasingly able to project their voices with unprecedented reach. However, an assumption is often made that young people have superior skills with digital technology, which surpass those of their parents and teachers. It may or may not be right. Many young people are confident in using a wide range of technologies and often turn to the internet for information. They seem able to learn to operate unfamiliar hardware or software very quickly and may take on the role of teaching adults how to use computers and the internet.
